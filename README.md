# ASCII-Binary Converter

## Overview
A powerful and simple Python-based utility designed to convert alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and special symbols into their corresponding 8-bit binary representations. This tool is specifically developed for Debian-based Linux distributions.

## Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3**: The programming language required to run the script.
- **Git**: Version control system (optional, but recommended for cloning the repository).

## Installation
You can easily install the necessary dependencies using the `apt` package manager. This applies to Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali Linux, and other Debian-based distributions.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Update your package list and install the requirements by running:
3. clone this repositiry.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3
git clone "specified this repository link"
```

## How to Use
1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `ASCII-Binary.py` script.
2.  Launch the program using Python 3:
    ```bash
    python3 ASCII-Binary.py
    ```
3.  When prompted `Enter the data:`, type the character you want to convert (e.g., `A`, `z`, `7`, `$`) and press **Enter**.

### Example
```text
$ python3 ASCII-Binary.py
Enter the data: A
01000001
```

## Features
- **Full Character Support**: seamlessly converts uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and a wide range of special characters.
- **Lightweight**: Written in pure Python 3 for efficiency.
- **User Friendly**: Simple command-line interface.
